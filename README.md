# Smart-Study-Buddy
Just a little Python + Gemini pipeline for lab-meeting fun. 

One fun thing: our professor gave us a task to create a small AI agent or workflow for lab meeting discussions. When we presented, all of the Asian people (Chinese, South Korean, and Nepalese) showcased tools for extracting information from PDFs, summarizing useful content from monthly industry magazines, or organizing time efficiently… Meanwhile, others presented things like mood-based music recommendations, “what to eat today” suggestions, and freshness checks for your food. Hah, CLASSIC us asians, always in a intense mode!!
